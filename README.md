# A Simple Demo for Auto Layout Constraints in Swift

Constraints can be set in two different general ways: Graphically and programmatically. Most people prefer the graphical way to set the constraints, working directly in the storyboard or XIB files. The big advantage of that option is that it offers immediate visual contact to the views that constraints should apply to, so you just “see and do”. However, and despite the easiness of this method, it’s highly possible to mess things up by setting contradictory constraints that cannot be satisfied simultaneously at runtime. Most of the times Xcode is quite helpful by indicating the misplaced constraints and providing tips on what’s wrong and problematic with the constraints, so you just proceed by fixing and updating your constraints until there are no more conflicts.
